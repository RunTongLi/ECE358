# Usage

## Generate and Run executable
- run make to generate executable simulator
- execute simulator to simulate q1, q3, q4, and q6
- data collected for q3 and q4 are saved in the csv files "q3e_n.csv", "q3p_idle.csv", "q6e_n.csv", and "q6p_loss.csv

## Generate Graph
- run "make graphq3" to generate graphs for question 3.
- run "make graphq6" to generate graphs for question 6.
- run "make graph" to generate all graphs
- The generated graphs for q3 are in "q3_avgPack.png" and "q3_idleProportion.png"
- The generated graphs for q6 are in "q6_avgPack.png" and "q6_packLoss.png"
