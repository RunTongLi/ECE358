# Usage

## Generate and Run executable
- run make to generate executable simulator
- execute simulator to simulate q1 and q2
- data collected for q1 and q2 are saved in the csv files "efficency_1.csv", "throughput_1.csv", "efficency_2.csv", and "throughput_2.csv"

## Generate Graph
- run "make graphq1" to generate graphs for question 1.
- run "make graphq2" to generate graphs for question 2.
- run "make graph" to generate all graphs
- The generated graphs for q1 are in "efficency_1.png" and "throughput_1.png"
- The generated graphs for q2 are in "efficency_2.png" and "throughput_2.png"
